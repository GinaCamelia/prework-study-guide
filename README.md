## Description

I have built this guided step-by-step project to learn how to code and implement all the basic knowledge/concepts learned throughout this program.

The purpose of the project is to help me store and access information in a chronological order.

I can access notes and information related to front-end development technologies.

I have learned to structure the web page with HTML, to style and rearrange it with CSS, and to add interactivity with JS.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each section of the web page contains notes and information about a certain topic, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Open the DevTools console and see JS running and listing the topics I have studied in this course.
