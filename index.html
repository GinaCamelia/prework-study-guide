        <ul>
          <li>The <b>head</b> element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The <b>body</b> element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>margin</b> indicates how much space we want around the <b>outside</b> of an element;</li>
          <li><b>padding</b> indicates how much space we want around the content <b>inside</b> an element;</li>
          <li>To understand this better, it is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model.</li>
          <li>The <b> box-shadow</b> CSS property adds shadow effectsaround an element's frame. A <b>box-shadow</b> is decsribed by X and Y offsets relative to the element; blur and spread radius, and color.</li>
          <li><b>width</b> sets the width of an element;</li>
          <li><b>height</b> sets the height of an element</li>

        <ul>
          <li><b>git status:</b> checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li><b>git checkout -b branch-name:</b> creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>We use the <b>add -A</b> command to commit all files in the working branch.</li>
          <li><b>git commit -m</b> "add comment here" commits the changes; <br> We use the <b>-m flag</b> to associate a message with our commit. Commit messages should be short descriptive messages of the changes implemented. Once completed, our Git repository is now up to date with our working directory!</li>
          <li><b>git pull origin main</b> - It is a good habit to always pull the base branch into your feature branch before pushing up any code.</li>
          <li><b>git push origin</b> feature/add-html - pushing all the changes</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A <b>variable</b> is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Start by declaring a variable with the <b>let</b> keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable.</li>
          <li>A <b>semicolon</b> at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends.</li>
          <li>A <b>string</b> is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single quote marks.</li>
          <li>A <b>boolean</b> is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks.</li>
          <li>An <b>array</b> is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
          <li><b>Comments</b> are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments. You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS: /* Comment here */</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the <b>if...else</b> statement.</li>
          <li><b>Functions</b> are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code.</li>
          <li>A <b>for</b> loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
          <li><b>Control flow</b> is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
